# Weather Explorer

**A professional, user-focused web application for exploring weather history and predictions by location.**

---

## Overview

Weather Explorer lets users pick any location and date to view detailed historical weather data and short-term expectations. The app combines long-term historical records with forecasting to provide:

- A 10-year temperature trend for the selected date.
- Suggested best times to visit the location based on historical conditions.
- Side-by-side metrics: temperature, wind, storms, precipitation probability, max wind speed, humidity and an overall _weather score_.
- A one-week expectation forecast derived from historical averages and short-term model data.
- Interactive charts for weekly forecasts and probability distributions (temperature, wind, humidity).

This README explains how to run, configure, and contribute to the project.

---

## Highlights / Key Features

- Pick any **location** (coordinates or place name) and **date** (today or past).
- **Check Weather** button shows a 10-year historical temperature graph for that date and recommendations for best visiting times.
- **Weather Expectations** reveals the 7-day expected averages based on historical data + short-term forecasts.
- Metrics include `humidity`, `wind_speed`, `max_wind`, `precipitation_probability`, and a composite `weather_score` (0–100, higher is better).
- Multiple interactive charts: 10-year trend, 7-day forecast, and probability charts for temp/wind/humidity.

## Tech Stack (Recommended)

- Frontend: **React** (Vite) — fast dev experience and lightweight production build.
- Charts: **Chart.js** or **Recharts** for interactive graphs.
- Backend: **Node.js + Express** (or any preferred REST API framework).
- Data store: **PostgreSQL** (or any time-series-friendly datastore) for cached historical aggregates.
- Deployment: **Vercel / Netlify** (frontend) + **Heroku / Render / Railway** (backend) or a single fullstack host.

> Note: Adjust stack to match your preferences — the repository already includes a Vite + React frontend structure.

## Quickstart — Run Locally

**Prerequisites**: Node.js (v16+), npm or Yarn.

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn
```

3. Configure environment variables (create `.env`)

```bash
# Example .env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
API_KEY=your_weather_data_api_key
```

4. Start the frontend (Vite)

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Start the backend (if included)

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

6. Open the app in your browser at the URL printed by Vite (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`).

## API Endpoints (example)

These endpoints are suggested and should be adapted to your backend implementation.

- `GET /api/weather?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&date={YYYY-MM-DD}`

  - Returns historical aggregates for the requested date (10-year temperature trend + metrics).

- `GET /api/forecast?lat={lat}&lng={lng}`

  - Returns a 7-day forecast (expected averages, humidity, wind stats, and probabilities).

- `GET /api/recommendations?lat={lat}&lng={lng}`

  - Returns suggested best visiting times and short notes based on long-term patterns.

---

## Data Sources & Notes

- The app relies on public historical datasets and short-term forecasts. Common sources include NOAA, ECMWF, and NASA/open climate datasets. Replace with the exact source(s) and credentials you use.
- Historical data is aggregated to compute 10-year trends and daily averages used for the 7-day expectation.
- The `weather_score` is a composite metric you can define (e.g., lower precipitation + moderate temperatures + low winds → higher score).

---

## UI / UX Notes

- Keep interactions simple: location + date → **Check Weather** to surface the primary visualizations.
- Present recommendations prominently on the right side of the main view for quick decision-making.
- Use accessible charts (tooltips, labels, keyboard focus) and mobile-responsive layout.

---

## Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Serve production build (example)
npm run preview
```

Deploy the frontend to Vercel/Netlify and the backend to any cloud host. Use environment variables and secrets for API keys.

---

## Testing & Validation

- Add unit tests for backend aggregation functions (historical averages, probability calculations).
- Validate chart data with known test cases (e.g., synthetic time series) to ensure probabilities and averages are correct.
